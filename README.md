Task 3: Predictive Analytics

    Built a predictive model using a dataset of software development metrics.
    
    Preprocessed and cleaned data with pandas.
    
    Trained a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest or Linear Regression) to predict software performance indicators such as defect density or delivery time.
    
    Evaluated model accuracy using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R².
    
    Discussed ethical implications and data fairness.

💡 Bonus Task: AI Innovation Challenge (Extra 10%)

    Proposal Title: DocuMind – Intelligent Documentation Generator

Purpose:
    A proposed AI-driven tool that automates software documentation by analyzing codebases, commit messages, and architecture files to produce structured, human-readable documentation.

Workflow:
    
    Input source code repository.
    
    Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine analyzes code and comments.
    
    Generates technical summaries, UML diagrams, and Markdown/HTML docs.

Impact:

    Reduces developer workload in maintaining documentation.
    
    Enhances code readability and onboarding.
    
    Promotes consistency across software projects.
